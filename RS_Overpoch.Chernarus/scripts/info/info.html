We are here to play a fantastic game and all have a great time. Treat others how you would want to be treated. Hero and Bandits are welcome but are asked to keep it civil, and always have respect, There is no need for offensive language or any language to put down another player. Use your bullets not your words here. Let them do the talking for you. If you're killing the same player over and over again. get a life, find somebody else to toy with. Give them a chance to gear up and take you on fair. That's what you would want them to do if it was you right?<br>
